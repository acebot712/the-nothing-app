- Document deployment processes

## How to Use the Pre-Production Check Script

The `pre-production-check.js` script has been added to verify the app's readiness for production. Run it using:

```bash
npm run preproduction
```

This script checks:
- Environment variable configuration
- TypeScript type correctness
- ESLint rules compliance
- Console.log statements that should be removed
- Required files existence
- Pre-commit hooks configuration
- EAS build configuration
- Supabase connection (optional)

Fix any issues identified by this script before deploying to production.

## Pre-commit Hooks

The repository is configured with pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before changes are committed. These hooks:

- Prevent direct commits to the main branch
- Run ESLint and TypeScript checks
- Format code with Prettier
- Ensure no sensitive information is committed
- Check for merge conflicts and other common issues

For detailed information on the pre-commit setup, see [Pre-commit Hooks Configuration](../repo/PRE-COMMIT.md).

## Production Deployment Documentation

Refer to the following documentation in the `docs/infra/` directory:

- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed production deployment guide
- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Database configuration and troubleshooting
- `CI-CD-SETUP.md` - Continuous Integration and Deployment setup

Additionally, these files in the root directory are helpful:
- `supabase-schema.sql` - Database schema definition
- `supabase-setup.sql` - Database initialization script
- `test-database-connection.js` - Utility to verify database connectivity

## Ongoing Maintenance

For long-term production readiness, establish the following practices:

1. Regular dependency updates (use the dependency checks in the CI pipeline)
2. Security audits (use the security scanning workflow)
3. Performance profiling
4. User feedback collection
5. Regular backups of production data
6. Monitoring of app metrics
7. Periodic code reviews

By following these recommendations, the app will maintain its production readiness and provide a reliable experience for users.
