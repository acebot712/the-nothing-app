# Production Deployment Guide for The Nothing App

This guide provides instructions on how to build and deploy The Nothing App to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to production, ensure you have the following:

1. An Apple Developer Account (for iOS deployment)
2. A Google Play Developer Account (for Android deployment)
3. Expo Application Services (EAS) account
4. Proper configuration of Supabase (see `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`)

## Environment Setup

1. Ensure your `.env.local` file contains the production API keys:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_production_stripe_key
```

2. Verify `app.json` and `app.config.js` are properly configured with your production app details

## Building for iOS

1. Configure EAS credentials:

```bash
npx eas credentials
```

2. Update the `eas.json` file with your Apple account details:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "appleId": "YOUR_APPLE_ID",
      "ascAppId": "YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID",
      "appleTeamId": "YOUR_APPLE_TEAM_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Build the production iOS app:

```bash
npm run build:ios
```

4. Once the build is complete, submit to the App Store:

```

## Building for Android

}
```

3. Build the production Android app:
