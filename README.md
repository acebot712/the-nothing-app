# The Badge App

A minimalist app that shows a special badge when you log in - and nothing else.

## Features

- Simple login functionality
- Special badge display with animations
- Logout to clear your badge

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the app:

```bash
npx expo start
```

## How It Works

The app is intentionally minimalist, showing only a special badge when you log in. The badge has a shine animation effect and displays information including:

- Username
- Badge tier (Regular, Elite, or God Mode)
- Amount spent
- Serial number

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
